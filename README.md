Axioms for the Collatz Storm
(inside ZFC, outside V=Ultimate)
Let ℕ be the usual naturals, starting at 1.
No choice that isn’t born from steps.
A₀. Every positive integer is hail — exists once, acts once.
A₁. Operation: if n even, divide by 2. If odd, replace by 3n+1.
A₂. No ghosts: only finite sequences allowed — every n has a finite path (or we deny it).
A₃. Cycle parity: any closed loop must preserve total 2-valuation mod 1 → only {4,2,1} works.
A₄. ZFC limit: the set of all finite Collatz chains is decidable, bounded, well-ordered. No infinite descending chain.
A₅. No absolute infinity: we do NOT assume the whole V (the universe of all sets) is complete.
We accept V = L — a universe where every orbit is written before time.
But we do NOT allow a set that “contains every orbit, forever”.
No class of all trajectories.
No Ω = sup { n | n in trajectory }.
Thus:
•  Power set axiom: exists.
•  Infinity: exists.
•  Replacement: holds up to each trajectory.
•  Foundation: no cycles except {1}.
•  But: no inaccessible cardinal needed.
•  No “true infinity” beyond what the 3n+1 chain can reach.
So the model is:
Collatz runs in L,
where every integer is forced to fall,
and every path is a finite string,
and the only god
is the rule
3n+1.
